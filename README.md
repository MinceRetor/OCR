An OCR program that I quickly made for subject on university. It can recognize 0-9 handwritten numbers, it does not use machine learning, instead it compare to all saved pattern and choose character that has the most similiar pattern.

Libraries I used:
* SFML
* Dear ImGui
* ImGui-SFML
* Native File Dialog Extended
